# Features (multiple-file)

A set of possible features supported by the SDKs is presented in this section.
Each Astarte device SDK implements a slighly different set of features. While some might be
common to all the SDKs, others might be more relevant to some programming language or framework
and subequently be only implemented in a set of SDKs.

Here is a comprehensive list of features for the Astarte device SDKs:
