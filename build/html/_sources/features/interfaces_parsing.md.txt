# Interfaces parsing

The Astarte device SDKs are capable of parsing interfaces definitions expressed in a `.json` format.
All the interfaces definitions provided to a device make up the introspection of such device.
Each device will communicate its introspection to Astarte during the connection phase.

For more information regarding the definition of interfaces see the
[Astarte documentation](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/astarte/latest/030-interface.html).
