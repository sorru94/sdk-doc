# Device ID generation

An Astarte instance identifies each device through an unique identifier.
Some of the Astarte device SDKs provide utilities to generate a device ID in a deterministic or
random manner. Some SDKs can extract information from the hardware to generate an unique identifier.
For more information regarding the device ID format can be found in the
[Astarte documentation](https://docs.astarte-platform.org/astarte/latest/010-design_principles.html#device-id)
.
